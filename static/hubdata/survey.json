  "intro": "Tilson Broadband is evaluating opportunities around the country to build new and improved broadband networks that would serve residential and business users. It is evaluating which communities have high levels of interest in the services that these networks could deliver. These networks would deliver service via fiber optics, all the way to residential and business user locations. Fiber optic networks deliver reliable service and can support very high performance, with both gigabit upload and gigabit download speeds. We want to hear from users like yourself about your satisfaction with your current broadband service and your interest in subscribing to a new service delivered over an all-fiber optic network.",
